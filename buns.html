		<h2>1 Brown Sugar Mantou (Chinese Buns)</h2>
		<p>Different from bread, Chinese buns are made from plain flour instead of strong flour, and the basic ingredients are very simple: just flour, yeast, and water. But buns have hundreds of different forms and flavors. Those with fillings are called Baozi, while those without fillings are called Mantou.</p>
    	<p>One traditional sweet type of buns loved by millions of Chinese people is the brown-sugar Mantou, which often contains side-ingredients like dates and walnuts as well.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<div class="ingredients">
		<ul>
	    <li>Dried Yeast 3g</li>
		<li>Flour 260g <span class="inBold">(130g plain flour + 130g low-gluten flour recommended so as to make the texture more fluffy)</span></li>
		<li>Brown Sugar 30g</li>
		<li>Hot Water 90g</li>
		<li>Cold Milk 40g</li>
		<li>Walnuts 30g</li>
		<li>Raisins 30g</li>
		<li><span class="inItalic">Other dried fruits can also be used based on personal preference</span></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<div class="steps">
	<div class="left1">
	<p>1. Melt the brown sugar in hot water, then mix with cold milk. Put all the liquid and yeast and flour together. Use a mixer (or use your hands) to beat the mixture until it becoms a <span class="inBold">smooth and unstick</span> dough. <span class="inItalic">(If it sticks, add more flour; if it is too dry, add a small amount of water little by little.)</span></p>
	<p>2. Let the dough rest for about an hour (depending on the temperature) until it grows 1.5~2 times large as before.</p>
	<p>3. Roll the dough into a thin piece of rectangule (roughly), and place walnuts and raisins evenly onto it.</p>
	<p>4. Wrap up the fillings from the longer side of the dough into a long bar.</p>
	<p>5. Cut the bar into (8~9) sections and let them rest for 15~20 mins. <span class="inBold">(Second fermentation)</span></p>
	<p>6. Steam for 12 mins and <span class="inBold">don't remove the lid until 5 mins after the heat is turned off</span>, so as to prevent the buns from shrinking (due to a sudden change of temperature).</p>

	  <h2>2 Baozi Filled with Vegetables and Egg (Chinese Stuffed Buns)</h2>
	  <p>As a leading role on Chinese breakfast tables, Baozi is amazingly versatile with fluffy crust and all sorts of filling, which can be either saline or sweet. The ingredients of filling range from pork, shrimp, greens, to red bean and creamy custard.</p>
      <p>This specific kind of Baozi is completely made from non-meat products, but has a taste that goes beyond the delicacy of meat.</p>

	<p>2. Let the dough rest for about an hour (depending on the temperature) until it grows 1.5~2 times large as before.</p>
	<p>3. When the dough rest, let's make the filling. Wash the cabbage and carrot. Soak the black fungus in hot water one hour in advance. Then chop all the vegetables into tiny pieces.</p>
	<p>4. Crack the eggs in a bowl and mix them together. Fry the eggs and put them back into the bowl for future use.</p>
	<p>5. Add a spoon of oil into the wok and fry the black fungus and carrot for 3~5 mins. (Because these two are hard to cook.) Then put in the cabbage and stir-fry them together for another 2~3 mins. Finally add the fried egg and all the seasonings. Chop the eggs with spatula and mix everything well.</p>
	<p>6. The filling is now ready and can be removed from the wok into a large bowl.</p>

	<div class="right2">
    <p>7. The dough is now fermented and it will not shrink if you poke a hole with your finger. Roll it into a thick long bar and cut it into sections (8~10 is appropriate). </p>
	<p>8. Roll each section into thin and round disks. Put 1~2 spoon of filling onto it and squeeze the dough along the edge until the mouth is closed. Pinch the mouth tightly.</p>
