  <main id="main">
    <p>Different from bread, Chinese buns are made from plain flour instead of strong flour, and the basic ingredients are very simple: just flour, yeast, and water. But buns have hundreds of different forms and flavors. Those with fillings are called Baozi, while those without fillings are called Mantou.</p>
    <h2>1 Brown Sugar Mantou (Chinese Buns)</h2>
    <p>One traditional sweet type of buns loved by millions of Chinese people is the brown-sugar Mantou, which often contains side-ingredients like dates and walnuts as well.</p>

    <h2>2 Baozi Filled with Vegetables and Egg (Chinese Stuffed Buns)</h2>
    <p>As a leading role on Chinese breakfast tables, Baozi is amazingly versatile with fluffy crust and all sorts of filling, which can be either saline or sweet. The ingredients of filling range from pork, shrimp, greens, to red bean and creamy custard.</p>
    <p>This specific kind of Baozi is completely made from non-meat products, but has a taste that goes beyond the delicacy of meat.</p>
