      <h2>1 Lamb Pilaf</h2>
      <p>Lamb Pilaf originates from Xinjiang Province in northwestern China. In addition to lamb (typically lamb ribs, and sometimes lamb thighs), another highlight that cannot be neglected in this dish is raisins, which gives a touch of sweet to the rice as well as the meat. Carrots also contribute to part of the sweetness, since they become very soft after sufficient braising and the juice comes out.</p>
      <p>An innovation that I made to this cuisine is the dates, whose sweetness is honey-like and distinctive from that of others. Don't worry that the dish will be too sweet, since the use of soy bean source and pepper-salt will add saline taste to the lamb, which interconnects with the sweetness and brings an exceptional delicacy.</p>

      <h2 id="braisedPork">2 Braised Pork with Rice</h2>
      <p>Braised Pork with Rice is a traditional Taiwan dish, and can be commonly found at many restaurants around China and even around the world. It is also not hard to replicate at home, as long as you give 2 hours to let the tasty miracle grow step by step. The basic ingredients include pork (must be <span class="inBold">streaky pork/marbled meat</span>), red onions, and dry mushroom (available at any Chinese supermarket).</p>
