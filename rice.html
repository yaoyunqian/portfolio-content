		<h2>1 Lamb Pilaf</h2>
      	<p>Lamb Pilaf originates from Xinjiang Province in northwestern China. In addition to lamb (typically lamb ribs, and sometimes lamb thighs), another highlight that cannot be neglected in this dish is raisins, which gives a touch of sweet to the rice as well as the meat. Carrots also contribute to part of the sweetness, since they become very soft after sufficient braising and the juice comes out.</p>
      	<p>An innovation that I made to this cuisine is the dates, whose sweetness is honey-like and distinctive from that of others. Don't worry that the dish will be too sweet, since the use of soy bean source and pepper-salt will add saline taste to the lamb, which interconnects with the sweetness and brings an exceptional delicacy.</p>

		<h2 id="braisedPork">2 Braised Pork with Rice</h2>
      	<p>Braised Pork with Rice is a traditional Taiwan dish, and can be commonly found at many restaurants around China and even around the world. It is also not hard to replicate at home, as long as you give 2 hours to let the tasty miracle grow step by step. The basic ingredients include pork (must be <span class="inBold">streaky pork/marbled meat</span>), red onions, and dry mushroom (available at any Chinese supermarket).</p>
	  	<p>Braised Pork with Rice also have a variety of transformations. What I would like to introduce here is my own version with potato and asparagus bean, which is a good alternative choice for situations where you do not have dried mushroom at hand or if you do not like them.</p>

	  </div>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
	  <div class="ingredients">
		  <ul>
		  <li>Streaky Pork 350g</li>
		  <li>Red Onion 1/2</li>
		  <li>Potato 1 medium size (around 160g)</li>
		  <li>Asparagus Bean 3 (long strips)</li>
		  <li>Eggs #as many as you want (usually 3 for 3 people serving size)</li>
		  <li>Cooking Wine 1 spoon</li>
	      <li>Crystal Sugar 30g</li>
		  <li>Soy-Bean Sauce 3 spoons</li>
		  <li>Oyster Sauce 2 spoon</li>
		  <li>Multi-Flavored Natural Seasoning (in Chinese: 王守义十三香) 1 tsp</li>
		  </ul>
	  </div>
	  <h3>Steps</h3>
	  <p>1. Cut the pork and all vegetables into dices, and soak the meat in cooking wine for half an hour. In the meanwhile, boil the eggs for about 10~12 mins and put them in cold water before peeling off the eggshell (which makes it easier to peel).</p>  
	  <img src = "images/rice2-braised_pork_rice-step1.jpg" alt ="ingredients ready to braise the pork, eggs, and vegetables" title="ingredients ready to braise the pork, eggs, and vegetables">
      <p>2. Heat the wok and add at least 5 spoons of oil to fry the vegetables until they become softer and smell good. Then transfer them into a bowl for future use.</p>
	  <p>3. Do not wash the wok (leave the oil there). Directly put in the meat and fry until the pork dices turn a bit golden and the oil from the fat comes out.</p>
	  <p>4. Transfer the meat into a pot and pour in water until reaching the surface of the meat. Add all the seasoning stuffs into the pot, as well as the eggs <span class="inBold">(remember to make a few shallow cuts on the surface of the egg white so that it is easier to let the juice in)</span>.</p>
	  <p>5. Put on the lid and use medium heat to boil the water. Then turn to low heat to stew for half an hour.</p>
      <img src = "images/rice2-braised_pork_rice-step2.jpg" alt ="adding vegetables into the pot to be braised together with the pork and eggs" title="adding vegetables into the pot to be braised together with the pork and eggs">
      <p>6. Add all the vegetables in. Continue stewing for another hour. It is now ready to be served!</p>
	  <p>7. Place some rice on the plate and pour the brased pork with sauce onto it. You can also put some greens alongside to make the dish prettier (and healthier). Do not forget to put a brased egg as well!</p>
