  <main id="main">
    <p>Hi! I'm Cici Yao, a foodie as well as a home-cook from China. Agriculture civilization is fundamental in our country's history, and as an old saying goes, "food is paramount to the people". In recent centuries, the magic of Chinese food has gradually unrolled itself in lots of contries around the world. As a Chinese, I love to cook for my Chinese stomach, wherever I live. This site not only serves as a gallery for a few of my signature dishes, but also aims to familiarize you with some traditional Chinese cuisine.</p>

	<p>Just a bit more information about me: before being a feverish cooking lover, I have always been an amateur painter. Cooking appears to be similar in many ways to drawing. There's plenty of room for imagination. There's no right and wrong. There's no universal standards. Moreover, they are both an extended part of me. When these two hobbies collide, let's see the flower that blossomed between them:</p>
